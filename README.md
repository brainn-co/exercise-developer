# Exercise for Developers

This is our programming exercise. Our goal is to evaluate your programming skills level and then make an interview with better information about you. After your pull request to the `master` branch in your private repository, we will:

1. Do code review
2. Share our evaluation based on the list below
3. Invite you to an interview

# Guidelines

### What we will evaluate

We want to evaluate your ability to deliver clean code with sufficient documentation for other developers to understand what you did and actively contribute to the project.

1. `README.md` is well written, short and with the commands needed to run the application.
2. The code is well written, clean and cohesive.
3. Implementation of the solution is working as expected.
4. There is automated testing (i.e., the coverage of the tests).
5. There is linter/static code analysis.

For **back-end exercises**, we will also evaluate important aspects for this area.

6. RESTful API design is implemented, correctly using the `HTTP` verbs and the proper `Status Code`.
7. API documentation is using one good web tool (e.g., [Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/), [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), etc.), and not `pdf`, `txt` or any other file format.

For **front-end exercises**, we will also evaluate important aspects for this area.

6. There is good usage of Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3.
7. The screens were implemented exactly as it is in the wireframes provided, e.g., the position of the elements on the screen.

### Programming language

You may choose the programming language of your preference.

### How to share your code with us

We want you to experience how we work on a daily basis. That's why we ask you to use a standard gitflow as follows below.

1. Create a `README.md` file describing how to configure your project, containing the commands that must be run to run the software and the tests.
2. Open a new pull request to the `master` branch of the private repository that we have invited you to contribute.
3. If you have made use of any Linter (esling, rubycop, creed, etc.), send the file together with the project.
